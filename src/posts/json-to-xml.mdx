    JSON serves as an open format for data interchange that is comprehensible to both humans and machines. In contrast, XML is a 
    markup language that establishes guidelines for defining various types of data, utilizing tags to distinguish between data 
    attributes and the actual content. Although both formats facilitate data exchange, JSON is recognized as the more modern, 
    adaptable, and widely adopted choice.

    In the current era of interconnected systems, the necessity for data sharing across different formats is prevalent. While 
    JSON is favored for data interchange, numerous legacy systems and specific applications continue to depend on XML. Our JSON 
    to XML Converter effectively addresses this need by enabling swift and precise transformation of JSON data into XML.

    - **Compatibility Across Platforms**: Numerous enterprise applications, legacy systems, and particular APIs require data to 
    be formatted in XML. By transforming JSON into XML, you can facilitate smooth integration between contemporary and 
    traditional systems.

    - **Improved Data Exchange**: XML presents a comprehensive structure with customizable tags and attributes, which can be 
    advantageous for representing intricate data relationships. This transformation is particularly beneficial in sectors where 
    XML is the prevailing standard, such as finance, healthcare, and government.

    - **Uniform Data Format**: XML enforces stringent syntax regulations and accommodates features like namespaces, which can 
    help eliminate ambiguities when sharing data across systems. Converting JSON to XML enables you to take advantage of these 
    benefits without the need for manual data rewriting.

    provide, the tool will lint your JSON, presenting a list of detailed explanations
    for each error, enabling you to resolve the issues effectively.

    - **Customization**: The tool includes various customization features,
    such as adjustable user interface settings for the editors, the ability to upload
    data from a file on your machine for beautification, and customizable tab sizes.
    Additional customization options are planned for future update.

    - **Upload Data**: You can choose a JSON file from your device, and it
    will be automatically beautified.

    - **Download**: You can download the formatted result if you wish to share the formatted XML.

  <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
    Due the differences between the two formats not all valid JSON can be transformed into valid XML. Below are several examples 
    illustrating this issue:

    - **Keys Beginning with Numbers**: In JSON, keys may commence with numbers, whereas XML tags cannot. Consequently, when 
    converting a JSON object that includes keys starting with numbers, the resulting XML will be invalid.

    - **Unsupported Characters**: JSON keys can incorporate characters such as "!", which are not permissible in XML tags. 
    Therefore, JSON inputs containing such characters will result in invalid XML.

    - **Duplicate Keys**: While certain implementations of JSON permit duplicate keys, XML does not allow this. As a result, 
    JSON objects with duplicate keys may yield unexpected XML outputs.

    - **Data Types Lacking Direct XML Equivalents**: JSON values such as null or boolean types may not have a corresponding 
    representation in XML leading to unexpected outputs in the converter.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      The JSON to XML converter will remain free for all users indefinitely. No account is required to access its features. 
      While we intend to roll out certain functionalities exclusively for registered users, such as an ad-free experience 
      and the ability to create links, the core formatting service will always be provided at no cost.

      If the original JSON is invalid, the tool will be unable to complete the conversion process. In the left editor, 
      an error icon will appear, and hovering over it will display the details of the errors identified in your original JSON.

      We do not retain any data that you enter or paste into the editor during the conversion process. However, there are 
      two exceptions to this policy:

      - When you download the resulting XML, we temporarily store the information on our servers solely for the purpose of
      generating your output. Once the file is created for your download, it is promptly deleted.

      - If you generate a link for a specific XML, due to certain technical limitations regarding the storage of XML data 
      in the URL, we save the JSON in our databases, assign it an ID, and utilize that ID to facilitate the creation of a link
      (this feature is currently under development).
