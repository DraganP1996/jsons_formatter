    In the realm of programming, the act of transform back a string into its original structure is referred to as **deserialization**. 
    When it comes to JSON, there are several reasons to perform this conversion:

    - **Data transmission**: Communication protocols such as HTTP primarily focus on transmitting text-based data across a network.
    Developers frequently need to check the structure of a response prior to processing it in their code. This tool serves as an 
    effective solution for such scenarios.
    - **Storage**: Various storage systems are optimized for text handling. When extracting data from this type of database, it is
    frequently essential to convert the string into JSON format to effectively utilize the information.
    - **Use embedded JSON from URLs**: To effectively utilize the JSON from a URL, it is essential to deserialize it.

    Utilizing this tool is quite straightforward:

    1. Once you begin typing or pasting the String in the left editor, the converted result will be displayed in real time in the 
    right editor.
    2. If there are errors in the original input, the tool will be unable to serialize the result, requiring you to review and 
    correct the errors. Ensure that you include text that can be transformed into JSON or, alternatively, address the errors 
    systematically to attain the desired outcome.
    3. Throughout the conversion to a JSON, special characters will be unescaped, meaning a backslash (\) will be removed before
     them.

  headingMarkdown={"## What features does this tool offer?"}
  headerClass="text-2xl font-semibold font-electrolize"

  <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
    - **Instant String to JSON conversion**: As you begin typing or pasting content into
    the left editor, the right editor will display the deserialized version of your JSON.

    - **Error detection**: If there are any errors in the text source you
    provide, the tool will lint your input, presenting a list of detailed explanations
    for each error, enabling you to resolve the issues effectively.

    - **Customization**: The tool includes various customization features,
    such as adjustable user interface settings for the editors, the ability to upload
    data from a file on your machine for beautification, etc.
    Additional customization options are planned for future update.

    - **Upload Data**: You can choose a JSON file from your device, and it
    will be automatically converted to JSON.

    - **Download**: You can download the formatted result if you wish to share it.

  <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
    It is common for users of this tool to overlook that it functions as a **String to JSON converter**. Please ensure that the text 
    entered in the left editor is enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes; otherwise, the conversion will not be 
    successful.

    There are several prevalent mistakes that can result in invalid outputs or errors:

    - **Improper Formatting**: The string may not adhere to JSON syntax. For example, JSON requires for keys and string values
    to be enclosed in double quotes. A string formatted as ```{name: 'John'}``` or ```{'name': 'John'}``` is invalid due to the 
    improper quoting of keys or values.

    - **Trailing or Extra Commas**: If the string contains additional commas following the last element in an object or array, 
    it will not be recognized as valid JSON. For instance: ```{ "name": "John", }```

    - **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters within strings must be correctly escaped. If they are not (such as an 
    unescaped newline or control character), the editor will generate an error, preventing successful conversion.

    - **Incomplete or Malformed Data**: A string lacking essential braces, brackets, or quotes (for example, an incomplete 
    object or array) will not convert correctly.

    - **Plain Text That Isnâ€™t JSON**: A string such as ```"Hello, world!"``` on its own does not qualify as valid JSON.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      The String to JSON tool will remain free for all users indefinitely. No account is required to access its features. 
      While we intend to roll out certain functionalities exclusively for registered users, such as an ad-free experience 
      and the ability to create links, the core formatting service will always be provided at no cost.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      If the original String is invalid (a textual input that it is not possible to convert to JSON), the tool will be unable to 
      complete the conversion process. In the left editor, an error icon will appear, and hovering over it will display the 
      details of the errors identified in your original JSON.

      We do not retain any data that you enter or paste into the editor during the conversion process. However, there are 
      two exceptions to this policy:

      - When you download the minified JSON, we temporarily store the information on our servers solely for the purpose of 
      generating your output. Once the file is created for your download, it is promptly deleted.

      - If you generate a link for a specific JSON, due to certain technical limitations regarding the storage of JSON data in 
      the URL, we save the JSON in our databases, assign it an ID, and utilize that ID to facilitate the creation of a
       link (this feature is currently under development).
