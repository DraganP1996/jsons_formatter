    YAML and JSON are two formats used for data serialization that facilitate human-readable data exchange. They standardize the way 
    data is formatted for transfer between software applications, ensuring that the text is also comprehensible to humans. 
    Both formats organize data in key-value pairs. 

    Although YAML might seem like a superior option due to its data typing and user-friendly format, JSON is generally favored
    for its cross-compatibility. This preference arises from the fact that numerous applications and services are already 
    equipped to parse JSON data.

    Conversely, YAML has established a significant foothold in specific computing domains, largely due to its readability and 
    ability to include comments. Importantly, YAML serves as the main data serialization format for configuration files in 
    various automation, DevOps, and infrastructure as code (IaC) tools and services. For example, it is frequently utilized in Docker and Kubernetes configurations.

    This tool enables the **immediate conversion of valid JSON values into a YAML format**.

  <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
    - **Instant YAML conversion**: When you start entering or pasting content into the left editor, the right editor will show 
    the corresponding YAML output generated from the input JSON..

    - **Error detection**: If there are any errors in the JSON source you
    provide, the tool will lint your JSON, presenting a list of detailed explanations
    for each error, enabling you to resolve the issues effectively.

    - **Customization**: The tool includes various customization features,
    such as adjustable user interface settings for the editors, the ability to upload
    data from a file on your machine for beautification, and customizable tab sizes.
    Additional customization options are planned for future update.

    - **Upload Data**: You can choose a JSON file from your device, and it
    will be automatically beautified.

    - **Download**: You have the option to download the formatted result if you would like to share the YAML output.

    The conversion of JSON to YAML is not a frequent requirement; however, there are specific scenarios where this tool proves 
    to be highly beneficial.

    For instance, numerous modern container orchestration and deployment tools, such as Kubernetes and Docker Compose, 
    utilize YAML for their configuration files. In cases where configurations are in JSON format, employing this tool can 
    facilitate a quicker conversion process and help mitigate potential errors.

  headerClass="text-2xl font-semibold font-electrolize"

  <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
    Our converter is designed for ease of use:

    1. Once you begin typing or pasting the JSON in the left editor, the converted result will be displayed in real time in the 
    right editor.
    2. If there are errors in the original input, the tool will be unable to complete the conversion process, requiring you to review and 
    correct the errors.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      The JSON to YAML tool will remain free for all users indefinitely. No account is required to access its features. 
      While we intend to roll out certain functionalities exclusively for registered users, such as an ad-free experience 
      and the ability to create links, the core formatting service will always be provided at no cost.

      If the original JSON is invalid, the tool will be unable to complete the conversion process. In the left editor, 
      an error icon will appear, and hovering over it will display the details of the errors identified in your original JSON.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      We do not retain any data that you enter or paste into the editor during the conversion process. However, there are 
      two exceptions to this policy:

      - When you download the result YAML, we temporarily store the information on our servers solely for the purpose of 
      generating your output. Once the file is created for your download, it is promptly deleted.

      - If you generate a link for a specific YAML, due to certain technical limitations regarding the storage of JSON data in the
       URL, we save the JSON in our databases, assign it an ID, and utilize that ID to facilitate the creation of a link (this 
       feature is currently under development).
