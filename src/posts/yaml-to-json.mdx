    Utilizing the YAML to JSON tool offers several advantages. Although YAML is designed for enhanced human readability, JSON is 
    often the favored format among various programming languages and web APIs. By converting YAML to JSON, you enable your 
    configuration or data files to be readily processed by applications and services.

    Our tool facilitates the immediate conversion of any valid YAML into its corresponding JSON format.

    - **Instant JSON conversion**: When you start entering or pasting content into the left editor, the right editor will show 
    the corresponding JSON output generated from the input YAML.

    - **Error detection**: If there are any errors in the YAML source you
    provide, the tool will lint your YAML, presenting a list of detailed explanations
    for each error, enabling you to resolve the issues effectively.

    - **Customization**: The tool includes various customization features,
    such as adjustable user interface settings for the editors, the ability to upload
    data from a file on your machine for conversion, and customizable tab sizes.
    Additional customization options are planned for future update.

    - **Upload Data**: You can choose a YAML file from your device, and it
    will be automatically converted.

    - **Download**: You have the option to download the formatted result if you would like to share the JSON output.

    Our converter very simple to use:

    1. Once you begin typing or pasting the YAML in the left editor, the converted result will be displayed in real time in the 
    right editor.
    2. If there are errors in the original input, the tool will be unable to complete the conversion process, requiring you to review and 
    correct the errors.

    YAML's expressiveness surpasses that of JSON, leading to the possibility that not all valid YAML inputs can be converted into 
    valid JSON outputs without encountering errors or losing information. The following examples illustrate this point:

    - **Complex Data Types**: YAML accommodates complex data types, such as timestamps, custom tags, or non-string keys, which 
    lack direct counterparts in JSON. For example, a key in YAML may be a number or a boolean, whereas in JSON, all object keys 
    must be strings.

    - **Anchors and Aliases**: YAML features anchors and aliases that enable the reuse of nodes within the document. In contrast, 
    JSON does not provide a native mechanism for representing these references.

    - **Custom Tags**: YAML permits the use of custom data types through tags (e.g., !myType), a feature that JSON does not 
    inherently support without additional processing.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      The YAML to JSON tool will remain free for all users indefinitely. No account is required to access its features. 
      While we intend to roll out certain functionalities exclusively for registered users, such as an ad-free experience 
      and the ability to create links, the core formatting service will always be provided at no cost.

      We offer various options that enable the customization of results, including the ability to control tab size.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      If the original YAML is invalid, the tool will be unable to complete the conversion process. In the left editor, 
      an error icon will appear, and hovering over it will display the details of the errors identified in your original YAML.

    <AdditionalInfoSection className="">
      We do not retain any data that you enter or paste into the editor during the conversion process. However, there are 
      two exceptions to this policy:

      - When you download the result JSON, we temporarily store the information on our servers solely for the purpose of 
      generating your output. Once the file is created for your download, it is promptly deleted.

      - If you generate a link for a specific JSON, due to certain technical limitations regarding the storage of JSON data in the
       URL, we save the JSON in our databases, assign it an ID, and utilize that ID to facilitate the creation of a link (this 
       feature is currently under development).
