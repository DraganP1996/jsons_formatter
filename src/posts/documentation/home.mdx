## What is webeditors ? 

Webeditors simplifies the implementation and utilization of web editor components across various frameworks or even in the absence of a 
framework. This is achieved through the use of standardized web platform APIs and Web Components.

We offer a variety of packages, including a basic "vanilla" package designed for use in applications that do not depend on any frameworks, as 
well as several framework-specific packages that feature optimized code tailored for each framework. Below, you will find a link to 
the documentation for each specific package:
