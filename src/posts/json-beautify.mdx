    JSON, or **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation, is a widely used format for data interchange between
    applications. For a comprehensive overview of JSON, you may refer to this  [article](https://pages.github.com/).

    Over the past few decades, JSON has gained immense popularity due to its simplicity,
    making it accessible for both humans and machines. While machines can easily process
    JSON in any format, humans benefit from specific spacing and indentation conventions
    that enhance the clarity of the content within a JSON file.

    This tool is designed to swiftly convert JSON files into a more accessible format,
    facilitating easier data reading, especially for developers. It improves the original
    JSON by incorporating indentation and spacing, which greatly assists in debugging,
    editing, and understanding complex JSON structures. In the editors provided, the
    unformatted JSON appears on the left, while a more organized version is displayed on
    the right, showcasing a significant enhancement in readability for users.
